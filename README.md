# CleanCodeArchitecture 

The App consists of two screens with the below specifications Specification.
The first screen displays a list of dog breeds from the Dogs API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and presents the result in a scrolling list. Tap a breed from the list and navigate to the second screen.
The second screen will load 10 random dog images of the selected breed.

The App was developed in MVVM architecture with Android jetpack components to make the project lifecycle aware by following the clean code architecture and adding the test cases for the data layer, interactors layer, framework layer and presentation layer. And also added ViewModel testing, fragment, and navigation testing.
